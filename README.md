# LearningGuide
This project is for giving a guide for learning languages with a collection of projects.
These instructions/guides are program agnostic.
It won't tell the reader how exactly to write the code.
Instead it will give them a high level guide,
and allow the user to progress in the language of their choosing.

## Projects

### project-console

This project is about learning basic command line functionality of the language.
This should be possible with any programming langauge and is the basic first steps to learning software coding.
