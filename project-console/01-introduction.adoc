This should be your first challenge for learning a new programming language.
The famous "Hello, World" program.
In the classic program, the programmer will create a command line application that will print out "Hello, World" to the user.
It is rather simplistic, but its about getting the user wet their feet with the program.
This project will go a little further with instructing the user to have the program accept input and reply back accordingly.
